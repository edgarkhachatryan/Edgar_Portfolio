## [Time Series Forecast with horizon using electricity data](https://github.com/edgarkhachatryan/ExampleProjects/tree/master/ElectricityForecastWithTimeHorizon)
The project is aiming to create a Deep Learning model electricity consumption forecast using previous consumption level. The dataset was taken from PJM Interconnection LLC, which a regional transmission organization in the US. Dataset contains total provided electricity data for 12 companies in Megawatts. The current project uses consumption data for 2 companies:
1. Duquesne Light (DUQ) and,
2. American Electric Power Co., Inc. (AEP).
Duquesne Light provide electricity to the Allegheny and Beaver counties located in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, US inluding Pittsburgh city. American Electric Power Co. provides electricity to much broader territory, covering areas in Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan.
